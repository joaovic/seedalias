# seed alias
You don't need to memorize your wallet seeds, just your own created passphrase

Use this site to create an alias for your seed.
Define a passphrase (alias) which you are familiar and can always remember.
The passphrase will be used the encrypt and decrypt your seed.

After seed encryptation, you can scramble and save the encrypted seeds to a file and store it safely anywhere.

OBS: You should keep the passphrase secret, it's recomended that you do not write it down. 
It should be a sentense that you will never forget, so keep in your mind.

OBS2: To strength your encrypted seed you can use the scramble feature to swap one or more bytes of the encrypted seed.
Just provide a number refering to the position of the byte pairs to be swapped. Example: 
The number 1218 will swap the byte from position 12 by the byte from position 18.
You can provide a bigger number to swap more than one byte pair at time.
Use a meaningful number so it can be remembered easily, because you will need to use it to unscrambe the encrypted seed.

CAUTION: If you share the information generated by this page with anyone, they can steal your assets. 
Anyone asking you to share your secret passphrase or your seed is a scammer.
Do NOT copy & paste information from this page or send it to anyone offering to help you on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Etherscan, or Line.
They will steal your coins.
